/*
  Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).



Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false


Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

var isSubsequence = function(s, t) { //ab, baab
  let i = 0;

  for(let j = 0; j < t.length && i < s.length; j++) {
    if (t[j] == s[i]) {
      i++;
    }
  }

  return i === s.length;
};
